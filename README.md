# Strappi
Strappi is an electroacoustic piece written for the performer Marco Di Gasbarro. The composition is for a percussionist, Tibetan singing bowl, and live electronics.

## Compositional Intent
This piece stems from the need to rediscover writing with a minimal ensemble, allowing me to extract complexity from seemingly simple initial conditions.
The study of the instrument was carried out through a thorough spectral and temporal analysis, utilizing advanced audio content analysis techniques. The starting point was the observation of the instrument's physical body, focusing on those liminal areas that allow for the revelation and enhancement of its unique musical characteristics.


## Current Status
This piece represents a small step towards the development of an open system for live performance. The current state of the work involves a score of behaviors with aleatory elements. The ultimate goal is to create a system composed of various states that irreversibly modify the parameters of the algorithm, which self-regulates based on the information received from the performer. This piece explores a possible trajectory of a single state within the system, evolving through musical instances influenced by interpretative deviations caused by the randomness of behaviors.
